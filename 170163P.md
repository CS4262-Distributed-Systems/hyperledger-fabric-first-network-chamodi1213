1. Smart Contract

Smart contract is a program that is stored and run on the blockchain which is used as an agreement between participants and runs automatically when the predetermined conditions are met without an involvement of a third party.

2. Permissioned blockchain

Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain. Here the participants are known to each other but may not fully trust each other. A governance model is used to keep the trust and build a network. Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) or Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols can be used which rely on the participants' identities.
